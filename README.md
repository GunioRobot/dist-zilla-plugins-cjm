Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM
======================

Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM is a collection of plugins I've written for
Dist::Zilla.  The plugins here used to be distributed in
Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-CJM, but when I actually wrote @CJM, I decided
that it had too many prerequisites to be distributed with them.

I've written some other plugins that are distributed separately,
because they had different prerequisites.  The ones collected here
have fairly simple prerequisites, and I didn't want to have to make
separate distributions for all of them.

This is a Git repository where development of Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM
takes place.  For more information, visit
[Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM on CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM/).
This repository used to be called
[dist-zilla-pluginbundle-cjm](http://github.com/madsen/dist-zilla-pluginbundle-cjm),
but that now contains only @CJM.
